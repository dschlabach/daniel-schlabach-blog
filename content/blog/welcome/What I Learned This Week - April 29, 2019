## What I Did This Week

After deploying my Flashcards [app](mountfluency.com) last week, I tied up some loose ends with my server configuration and fixed some bugs on the front end. I also started sketching out and coding a basic prototype for my next project, a website to help you find the best coffee shops and roasters in your area.

## What I Learned

- Basics of React Hooks

- How to configure a server to auto-renew SSL certificates

- Basic Jest testing

- How to use [Figma](figma.com) to make a mockup of a website

- The `cover` CSS image property

- ~100 German words

## My Plan for Next Week

- Keep coding the prototype for my coffee website

- Learn 30 new German words per day
