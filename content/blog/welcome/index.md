Hi, my name is Daniel. I'm learning German and Russian while building a website to help me learn smarter.

I want to use this website to discuss and document my language learning goals and progress and the tools that I'm using to improve my language skills. I also want to give updates on the project I'm working on. For now, it's just called "Flashcards."

## Flashcards üß† üë®‚Äçüíª

I started building Flashcards in February when I decided that I wanted to learn web development. The goal was pretty simple: build a web version a spaced repetition software (i.e. Anki) that was specifically tailored to language learners.

Anki is a fantastic tool that I've used in the past to help me learn Russian and German, but there are a couple things that could be improved. [^1] Most importantly, I wanted integrated, automatic pronunciation whenever I added a word. For some reason, I think I learn best when I am able to both see _and_ hear a word.

I used to manually search for a word on [Forvo](https://www.forvo.com) (a crowdsourced pronunciation website), download the mp3, and drag that into my Anki field, but that got tedious and detracted from my time learning. I could probably have worked with Anki and written a plug in, but thought it would be fun to code my own solution.

When you add a flashcard to a deck in my app, the back end will take care of getting the Forvo integration. Then anytime you review a word, you can just press play to hear the word pronounced by a native speaker.

I also wanted to give the interface an update. Anki's design is a little stale. Yes, I could solve that by writing CSS for an Anki card's styling, but the goal here was also to learn to build a React app.

I don't have the back end wired up yet, but you can check out a preview of my work [here](https://kind-jang-c6c0aa.netlify.com/).

## German üá©üá™

I grew up speaking a dialect of German called [Pennsylvania Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch). I got to high school and took High German classes, but didn't end up progressing much due to the large class size/overall just bad learning methods that come with high school language classes. When I got to Duke, I took one semester of entry level German before deciding I was bored.

I always knew I wanted to come back to German at some point, and I've decided to pick it back up. I have a pretty solid base, so I'm skipping most of the introductory learning process and trying to dive into content. I would call my German level today a rusty intermediate. I'm hoping things come back to me quickly as I start taking in language content.

I'll detail more of my German-specific goals in an upcoming post.

## Russian üá∑üá∫

As I mentioned above, when I got to college I soon grew tired of repeating the German classes I had taken the last three years. I liked learning languages, so I thought it was to stay in a language class I knew I'd be bored in when I could otherwise be taking other language courses and learning something new. I narrowed the list to Chinese and Russian, and ended up with Russian on my schedule.

I planned to take 3 semesters of Russian to fulfill my Foreign Language requirement, but I ended up loving my professors and the language so much that it became my second major. I read and understand the language pretty well. What I'm focused on now are:

    1. Improving my pronunciation
    2. Expanding my vocabulary
    3. Learning more advanced grammar
    4. Brushing up on grammar that's tough to remember (certain declension, e.g.)

I'll detail more of my Russian-specific goals and tools in another upcoming post.

[^1] I should mention that since starting Flashcards, I've discovered that I could have probably changed worked with Anki to fix these issues rather than code up something completely new, but half of my motivation to build the website came from a desire to learn web development, so here we are.
